/* The for principles of "this";
* in your own words. explain the four principle for the "this" keyword below.
*
* 1. Global Binding - The value of "this" in the global scope will be the window or console object.
* 2. Implicit Binding - Whenever a function is called by a preecing dot, the object left of the dot gets "this".
* 3. New Binding - Whenever a constructor function is used, "this" will refer to the specific instance of the object that is created and returned ny the constructor function.
* 4. Explicit Binding - When the 'call' or 'apply' method is used, "this" is explicitly defined.
*
* write out a code example of each explanation above
